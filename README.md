# docker-slic3r-prusa3d

This repository tracks [Prusa3D's Slic3r fork](https://github.com/prusa3d/slic3r/) and triggers a Docker hub build when releases are tagged there. The files here contain the Dockerfile and supporting scripts.

To grab and run this (built on the Docker hub):

    docker run -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -v $PWD:/Slic3r/3d:rw \
    -v slic3rSettings:/home/slic3r \
    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
    --rm keyglitch/docker-slic3r-prusa3d

* Your current directory will be mounted into the container at /Slic3r/3d (change the :z option as appropriate to :rw/:ro).

* Settings are persisted into the slic3rSettings volume.

* Fedora users: SELinux might block access to X by slic3r inside the container. Look in /var/log/messages or /var/log/audit/audit.log to see if this is happening (and for the relevant commands to fix).

* Alternatively, there might be a permission error upon trying to access X. Try running `xhost local:root` to fix (this is a temporary fix and must be reapplied when restarting the host).

Sample error example:

    No protocol specified
    19:13:54: Error: Unable to initialize GTK+, is DISPLAY set properly?

### Building the latest release locally

If the hub version is ever out of date (or for any other reason), it is possible to build an image locally. `getLatestSlic3rRelease.sh` will automatically try to get the latest non-AppImage version through the GitHub API during the build process.

Building:

    $ docker build -t docker-slic3r-prusa3d .
    Sending build context to Docker daemon 73.73 kB
    Step 1 : FROM debian:stretch

### Convenience Script

A [small script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidk/docker-slic3r-prusa3d/master/slic3r.sh) wraps the `docker run` command above. It also contains a commented out snippet for poking around the persistent volume.

#### Example

    $ echo $PATH
    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/davidk/.local/bin:/home/davidk/bin
    $ cp slic3r.sh /home/davidk/.local/bin/slic3r
    $ chmod +x /home/davidk/.local/bin/slic3r
    $ slic3r
